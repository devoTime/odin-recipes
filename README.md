# odin-recipes

This is a project for The Odin Project recapping basic components of HTML.

It is a simple recipe web page composed of a home page and three recipe pages linked to the homepage. The recipe pages have a picture of the recipe, a description, the ingredients, and the steps for making it.

Actions:

* The creation of a repository on Github and cloning that to the local machine using SSH

* Usage of Git with the command line interface, including basic commands like add, commit, status, log, mv, mkdir, rm, touch, code (VSCode), and push

* Writing commit messages

* HTML basics. Boilerplate, basic tags (`<p>`, `<h1>`), anchor tags & links, lists, images

* Setting images sizes with HTML
